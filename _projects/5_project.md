Participated in as 3rd mentor team leader. This is our [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/@aitechplay2).<br>
Based on [MIT autonomous driving educational material](https://mitll-racecar-mn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#), taught students how to build artificial intelligence inside self-driving cars using python.

Below is an example video of a self-driving racecar following the line in the simulation environment.
