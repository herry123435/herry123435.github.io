In this project, we gave an ability to comprehend and execute complex tasks specified through natural language to robotic agent. The robot determines its next action by integrating real-time visual input from its cameras with the natural language commands it received.

The following video shows an egocentric view of a robot, from the moment it receives the natural language command 'Score a goal' until it successfully kicks a soccer ball into the goalpost.
