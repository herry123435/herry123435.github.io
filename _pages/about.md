I am a final-year undergraduate student in [Computer Science and Engineering Dept. at the Seoul National University](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/). I worked with Prof. Jonghyun Choi(SNU), Prof. Bongwon Suh(SNU), Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras(Georgia Tech) as an undergraduate researcher.

I aim to build a cognitive physical system that can **understand physical constraints** within a scene, **reason about potential interactions** based on those constraints, and leverage these inferences to perform tasks through **natural language interaction with humans**.
